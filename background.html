        <h2>Why EAS UCSD?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>Empowering Asian Students</strong></em> at UC San Diego addresses the unique needs of a substantial demographic. Students from East Asia, particularly China, represent one of the largest groups of international students in U.S. universities, despite recent minor enrollment dips due to factors like the pandemic. Chinese students alone numbered nearly 289,526 in the 2022-2023 school year, taking up 27.4% of all incoming students.<sup>1, 2</sup> However, this group often faces specific challenges beyond language barriers, with cultural gaps impacting social integration and academic confidence.<sup>3</sup> These students frequently navigate information gaps about resources and campus life, which hinders their ability to thrive. While many are proficient in English, cultural nuances in communication, academic expectations, and social norms can lead to feelings of isolation or misunderstanding, highlighting the need for targeted support structures.</p>

        <p>Moreover, recent findings reveal that mental health and cultural adjustment challenges are common but uniquely complex for this group, which includes diverse Asian and Asian American backgrounds. Studies indicate that Asian American students often encounter higher levels of suicidal ideation yet are least likely to seek support.<sup>4</sup> This is partly due to cultural norms that discourage discussing mental health and the difficulty of finding ethnically matched, culturally attuned mental health providers on campus.</p>

        <p>Beyond that, the model minority myth, which stereotypes Asian students as inherently high-achieving and resilient, can inadvertently add to their challenges. This myth can lead to their needs being overlooked by educators, who may assume these students do not require additional support.<sup>5</sup> Consequently, Asian students may feel isolated or unsupported, especially if they don't align with these expectations.</p>

        <p>Given these challenges, <em><strong>Empowering Asian Students</strong></em> seeks to bridge these gaps by fostering a supportive, culturally sensitive environment that promotes integration and shared experiences for both international and domestic students of Asian descent. This initiative is essential in creating a campus community where all students feel welcomed and empowered.</p>
